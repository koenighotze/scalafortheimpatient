But in my case I wanted to do
something more like flat map in this case, I want a
map to come out that misses out the key 1 because it’s value is None.
flatMap doesn’t work on maps like mapValues, it get’s passed the tuple and if it
returns a List single items you’ll get a list back, but if you return a tuple you’ll get a Map back.
